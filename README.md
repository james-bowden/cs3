# cs3
Collection of projects done as part of Caltech's Software Design course.Written from scratch in C.

*The Caltech Honor Code applies; please do not consult/use this repo if you are taking the course or will be taking the course in the future.*

Projects represent the development of a game development library with a physics engine. Structs were abstracted and built off of each other. Some of these structs include:
* vectors
* polygons
* bodies
* scenes
* forces
* collisions

The final project, which uses all of these structs for an escape game, can be found at https://github.com/james-bowden/AI-lien
